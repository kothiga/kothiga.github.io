### Description

HRI Physio Lib is a research project I created and worked on during my Master of Applied Science degree. I developed this project with the [Social and Intelligent Robotics Research Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/social-intelligent-robotics-research-lab/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), led by [Prof. Kerstin Dautenhahn](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/profile/kdautenh).

The project aims to develop a framework for developing physiologically adaptive robotic scenarios. By exploring the designs of previously developed systems, we can better provide a general structure and multi-purpose tools to help facilitate the integration of physiological signals into human-robot interaction (HRI) applications.

Advancements in unobtrusive commercial wearable physiological sensors (such as the Apple Watch) have introduced new opportunities to develop interactive robots which respond and adapt to real-time measurements of autonomic responses. These can include subtle changes in heart rate, skin perspiration, body temperature, pupil dilations, and more. From these measurements, subjective experiences such as user-experience, task performance, emotions, and cognitive workload can be approximated. 

The project is open-source and can be found [here<i class="fab fa-fw fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/kothiga/hri-physio).

We have two publications describing a conceptual framework, and open-source software library to facilitate the development of physiologically adaptive HRI scenarios:
* HRI Physio Lib: A software framework to support the integration of physiological adaptation in HRI [<i class="fa fa-link"></i>](../pubs/ICSR_2020_HRI-Physio-Lib)
* Connecting humans and robots using physiological signals -- closing-the-loop in HRI [<i class="fa fa-link"></i>](../pubs/RO-MAN_2021_Connecting_humans)
