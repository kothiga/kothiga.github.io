### Description

iCub Audio Attention is a research project I worked on during my Undergraduate degree. I helped to develop this project with the Cognitive Robotics Lab at the [University of Lethbridge](https://www.ulethbridge.ca/), led by [Prof. Matthew Tata](https://www.ulethbridge.ca/artsci/neuroscience/dr-matthew-tata).

The project aims to develop signal processing algorithms and audio capture tools for auditory perception for the iCub humanoid robot.

I have received funding for this project from NSERC (USRA), Mitacs (Globalink), and the University of Lethbridge (Chinook). During the Fall 2018 semester, I was a visiting researcher at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa, Italy, to further develop the pipeline and ensure it works well on the iCub robot.

The project is open-source and can be found [here<i class="fab fa-fw fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/TataLab/iCubAudioAttention).

We have two publications describing the main architecture, and a speech-specific filtering technique:
* A Bayesian system for noise-robust binaural sound localisation for humanoid robots [<i class="fa fa-link"></i>](../pubs/ROSE_2019_A_Bayesian_System)
* Speech envelope dynamics for noise-robust auditory scene analysis in robotics [<i class="fa fa-link"></i>](../pubs/IJHR_2021_Speech_envelope)
