### Description

Embodied Social Interface is a course project that I worked on as my course project for SYDE750: Artificial Life. This project acted as a small toy implementation of my larger PhD research project. A small user study was conducted, to gather some early qualitative and quantitative data, before running a full user study.

This project focuses on the ideas of social embodiment and communication. In this user study, you will be playing a puzzle game inspired by the Tower of Hanoi. A simulated version of the humanoid robotics platform, iCub, will provide hints during the game. You can choose to pay attention to the robot or make move decisions based on what you think is best.

The project is open-source and can be found [here<i class="fab fa-fw fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/kothiga/Embodied-Social-Interface).
