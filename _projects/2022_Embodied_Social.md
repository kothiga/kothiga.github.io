### Description

This project focuses on the ideas of social embodiment and communication. In this user study, you will be playing a puzzle game inspired by the Tower of Hanoi. A simulated version of the humanoid robotics platform, iCub, will provide hints during the game. You can choose to pay attention to the robot or make move decisions based on what you think is best.

The project is open-source and can be found [here<i class="fab fa-fw fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/kothiga/Embodied-Social-Interface).
