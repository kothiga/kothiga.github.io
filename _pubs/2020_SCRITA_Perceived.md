### Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
Robotic failures are an inevitable occurrence. This study tries to shed light on how people perceived failures and how much they affect the interaction. Continuing the work on a previous reliable study, this research gathers information on how people perceive a failure in an online validation study. After the failures have been selected, they were applied in a real-world game-like scenario where participants played a Treasure Hunt game with iCub. Initial results show that failure perception is more severe in the online study rather than the actual game.
